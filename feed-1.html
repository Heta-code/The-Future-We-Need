                <p>Each year, millions of acres of forest around the world are destroyed or degraded by fire. The same amount is lost to logging and agriculture combined. Fire is often used as a way to clear land for other uses such as planting crops.</p>

                <p>Smog is air pollution that reduces visibility. The term "smog" was first used in the early 1900s to describe a mix of smoke and fog. The smoke usually came from burning coal. Smog was common in industrial areas, and remains a familiar sight in some cities today. Today, most of the smog we see is photochemical smog.</p>

                    <p>Which compares each x variable to output y variable(growing stock).In the context of growing stock, "x" could represent one or more independent variables or factors that are believed to influence the growth of a particular stock, such as time, environmental conditions, management practices, or other relevant variables. The variable "y" would represent the dependent variable, which is the measured or observed growing stock.

                        Comparing "x" variables to the output "y" variable involves analyzing the relationship between the independent variables and the growing stock. This analysis could include various statistical techniques, such as regression analysis, correlation analysis, or other modeling approaches.</p>

The line plot would display the trend or pattern of the growing stock over the years.

                        By plotting the data points and connecting them with lines, the line plot provides a visual representation of how the growing stock changes over time. This can help identify any noticeable trends, such as increasing or decreasing stock values, periods of stability or volatility, or any other patterns that may emerge.</p>

                      <br>
                    <p>To forecast future data of growing stock using matplotlib in Python, you would typically follow these steps:

                        Load and preprocess your historical data: Start by loading your historical growing stock data into a pandas DataFrame. Preprocess the data as needed, such as handling missing values, converting data types, or scaling the values.
                        
                        Prepare the data for forecasting: Split the data into training and testing sets. The training set should include the historical data up until the desired forecasting period, while the testing set contains the remaining data.
                        
                        Choose a forecasting model: Select an appropriate forecasting model for your data. Popular models for time series forecasting include ARIMA, SARIMA, and Prophet. Depending on your specific requirements and data characteristics, you can choose the most suitable model.
                        
                        Fit the model and make predictions: Train the forecasting model using the training data. Adjust the model's parameters as necessary to achieve the best fit. Once trained, use the model to make predictions for the desired future time period.
                        
                        Visualize the forecast: Use matplotlib to plot the historical growing stock data along with the forecasted values. Plotting the data can help visualize the trend, seasonality, and forecasted values, allowing you to assess the accuracy of the model.
                        
                        Evaluate the forecast: Compare the forecasted values with the actual values from the testing set to evaluate the performance of the model. You can use metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) or root mean squared error (RMSE) to quantify the accuracy of the forecast.
                        
                        By following these steps, you can use matplotlib to forecast future data of growing stock and visualize the results. Keep in mind that the choice of forecasting model and the accuracy of the forecast will depend on the specific characteristics of your data and the chosen model's performance.</p>

                      <p>To plot the predicted values of growing stock year-wise using matplotlib, you can follow these steps:

                        Obtain the predicted values: Once you have trained your forecasting model and made predictions for the desired future time period, extract the predicted growing stock values for each year.
                        
                        Prepare the data: Create two arrays or lists: one for the years and another for the corresponding predicted growing stock values. Ensure that the data is in the appropriate format for plotting.
                        
                        Create a line plot: Use the matplotlib library in Python to create a line plot. Set the years as the x-axis and the predicted growing stock values as the y-axis. Customize the plot as needed by adding labels, titles, and formatting options.
                        
                        Display the plot: Show the plot using the plt.show() function or save it to a file using the plt.savefig() function.
                        
                        By following these steps, you can use matplotlib to create a line plot that displays the predicted values of growing stock year-wise. The plot will help visualize the trend and pattern of the predicted values over time.</p>
