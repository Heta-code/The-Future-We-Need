# The-Future-We-Need
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to contribute to environmental conservation efforts and predict the growing stock of forests in Indian states. 
The repository contains a comprehensive dataset spanning from 2011 to 2021, encompassing forest area, vegetation density factor (VDF), mean tree density factor (MDF), organic fraction (OF), and rainfall information.

Key Features:

Dataset: The repository provides a well-structured dataset consisting of historical data on forest-related metrics for Indian states over a ten-year period.
Machine Learning Models: Utilizing this dataset, various machine learning models have been implemented to predict the growing stock of forests based on the provided features.
Jupyter Notebooks: The repository includes Jupyter notebooks showcasing the data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation processes. These notebooks serve as a guide for understanding the project's workflow.
Documentation: Detailed documentation is available to provide insights into the project's methodology, data sources, and model performance.
Contributions: We welcome contributions from the community to enhance the accuracy of the models, explore additional features, or propose improvements to the existing codebase.
By combining the power of machine learning and AI with comprehensive forest data, this project aims to contribute to the preservation and sustainable management of India's forests. Whether you are interested in environmental conservation, data analysis, or machine learning, your contributions to this repository can make a significant impact on understanding and predicting forest growth patterns.
